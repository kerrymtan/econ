"<a href="research/NEA_RuppTan.pdf" target="_blank">Untying the Knot: The Competitive Impact of Undoing the Northeast Alliance</a>," with Nicholas Rupp. (Forthcoming Book Chapter: <i>Advances in Airline Economics, Vol. 13</i>)<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This paper analyzes the Northeast Alliance (NEA) &mdash; a joint venture between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways at four New York and Boston airports between 2021 and 2023.  Under this codesharing agreement, the two airlines jointly scheduled flights and shared revenue. We show that American and JetBlue were significantly more likely to offer codesharing in markets currently served by Delta and United. These findings are a stark contrast to Goetz and Shapiro (2012) who find that codesharing agreements between 1998 and 2010 were a competitive response by legacy carriers to actual and potential competition from low-cost carriers. Using an event study approach, we also document significantly higher prices in NEA markets both during the NEA and surprisingly after the NEA ended. Our findings lend support for the Department of Justice’s decision to challenge this joint venture between American and JetBlue and justification for the District Court’s ruling that the NEA was anti-competitive.

<b>Abstract</b>: H.R. 5900, which was passed by Congress in July 2010, legislated more restrictive pilot rest requirements and increased the number of pilot training hours required to obtain an airline transport pilot license. This paper examines the effect that raising the occupational licensing standards have had on airline service quality. A priori, the effect is ambiguous since putting in place more restrictive licensing requirements reduces the available pool of replacement pilots and may cause airline pilots to behave opportunistically and put forth less effort, which suggests a detriment to on-time performance. On the other hand, well-rested and more experienced pilots may provide enhanced productivity leading to improved on-time performance. Our event study analysis surrounding the effective date of H.R. 5900 (August 2013) shows an increase in traditional delays in the short run amid an ongoing pilot shortage, while extended delays were also exacerbated in the short run as a result of binding work schedule restrictions.

<b>Abstract</b>: We study the impact of tacit collusion on price dispersion in the U.S. airline industry. We find that tacit collusion driven by multimarket contact has a positive effect on prices, but a negative effect on price dispersion.  Our empirical results suggest that airfares throughout the price distribution increases, yet the price distribution becomes more compressed since 10th percentile airfares increase by a larger amount than 90th percentile airfares. Moreover, we also find that this pricing phenomenon does not exist if Southwest Airlines is present on the route.  Thus, route-level price competition is softened when the same airlines directly compete more frequently, except when Southwest Airlines services that route.  As such, our empirical analysis provides evidence that the presence of Southwest Airlines exhibits an anti-collusive effect.

<b>Abstract</b>: Although the goal of licensing is to ensure the quality of services, it can also induce firms to operate informally or exit altogether.  This paper examines licensing in the rental housing market  by developing a model that indicates licensing's impact on the size of the underground rental market, the number of vacancies, and homelessness are ambiguous.  As a result, we calibrate the model using a unique dataset from Baltimore, which allows us to directly observe underground rentals and vacancies.  Our calibrations show that licensing may have a modest impact on rents, while increasing quality more substantially.

<b>Abstract</b>: This paper explores the impact of cyclical macroeconomic fluctuations on corporate R&ampD spending. Most existing studies are conducted at the industry or firm level and find procyclical corporate R&ampD. Some of these studies also provide evidence suggesting credit constraints play an important role in explaining the cyclical behavior of R&ampD.  Our analysis of the relationship between GDP, credit, and R&ampD begins with a theoretical model that allows for the possibility of credit constraints.  We then turn to an empirical analysis of a panel of 22 advanced economies. Our most robust empirical finding is that R&ampD is symmetrically procyclical even after controlling for credit market conditions. We conclude that credit market conditions are not sufficient to fully explain the procyclical behavior of R&ampD and that procyclical incentives for innovative activity are also likely to play an important role.

<b>Abstract</b>: This paper investigates how de-hubbing, which occurs when an airline ceases hub operations, impacts product quality. Examining four cases of de-hubbing following U.S. airline mergers between 1998 and 2016, we analyze three product quality measures: on-time performance, travel time, and flight cancellations. In order to isolate a merger's impact on product quality, we compare the results of four de-hubbing events that followed a merger with three de-hubbing cases that occurred independently of a merger. We find a silver lining from mergers since product quality improvements are isolated to de-hubbing events which follow airline mergers rather than non-merger induced de-hubbing.

<b>Abstract</b>: This paper investigates the determinants and competitive effects of legacy carriers' outsourcing decision with independent regional airlines.  Legacy carriers allocate a larger share of their operations to an independent regional airline partner compared to their own fleet or a wholly owned regional airline on routes that experience stronger competition, particularly from low-cost carriers.  Moreover, legacy carriers' airfares are lower on routes that they outsource more prominently to an independent regional airline.  The results suggest that increased route competition is a motivation for the growing use of independent regional airlines by legacy carriers.

<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This paper investigates the impact of output and credit market shocks on R&ampD spending in advanced economies and builds on the commonly accepted view that credit constraints lead to procyclical R&ampD spending. A theoretical model is developed where output and credit shocks are treated separately, though these shocks may be highly correlated. The estimation procedure utilizes a panel vector autoregression (VAR) in order to empirically identify the role of credit market shocks separately from the output shocks more commonly studied in the existing literature. The primary empirical findings can be summarized as follows: (1) R&ampD responds pro-cyclically to output shocks at the macroeconomic level, and (2) R&ampD co-moves positively with credit. More concretely, the results indicate that negative output shocks induce a simultaneous and subsequent contraction in credit and R&ampD consistent with a model where credit constraints drive cyclical adjustments to R&ampD. The impact of output and credit shocks on R&ampD are economically significant and a simulation exercise suggests the shocks associated with the global financial crisis have reduced US R&ampD by 10% relative to the pre-crisis path.

<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This paper studies incumbent price response to entry by low-cost carriers in the U.S. airline industry.  I find that legacy carrier incumbents decrease their mean airfare, 10th percentile airfare, and 90th percentile airfare following entry by a low-cost carrier.  Airfares decrease by a larger percentage at the right tail of the incumbents' price distribution than at the left tail, suggesting that increased competition from low-cost carrier entrants leads to lower price dispersion.

<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This paper studies the price effect of de-hubbing, which occurs when an airline ceases hub operations at an airport.  We develop a simple theoretical model to study the impact of de-hubbing on prices and quantities of direct flights at the hub airport.  Using an event study of seven cases of de-hubbing between 1993 and 2009, we analyze how average airfares change following de-hubbing.  Consistent with the theoretical implications, the empirical results suggest that airfares decrease when there is a low-cost carrier presence at the de-hubbed airport, whereas airfares increase when the de-hubbed airport is not serviced by a low-cost carrier.

<b>Abstract</b>: This paper builds a model of Schumpeterian innovation and trade that emphasizes endowments of innovators and labor as a key factor in determining the pattern of trade. The model suggests a strong complementarity between intraindustry and interindustry trade. The pattern of interindustry vs. intraindustry trade is analyzed using the Grubel Lloyd index. The theoretical model predicts that the prominence of intraindustry trade is a nonlinear function of the ratio of the proportion of world knowledge domestically generated to the domestic share of the world labor supply. Strong empirical evidence for this key result is presented and implications are discussed.

<b>Abstract</b>: Gulf carriers, such as Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, have expanded aggressively and are creating an increasingly dense global network.  These carriers’ future growth prospects, however, hinge on their ability to gain access to lucrative markets in Europe and America, for example.  Existing bilateral agreements stifle the Gulf carriers' ambitious expansion plans in some instances, and incumbent carriers lobby to restrict further market access.  To contribute to this debate, the objective of this research is to empirically examine the effects of Gulf carrier competition on U.S. carriers’ passenger volumes and fares in international route markets.  Based on data obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the empirical results suggest that greater competition by Gulf carriers in U.S. international markets is associated with 1) significant growth in U.S.-Middle East traffic volumes and 2) small but statistically significant traffic losses and fare reductions for U.S. carriers in route markets connecting the U.S. with Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe.

<b>Abstract</b>: Economic theory suggests that increasing minimum wage could lead to a decrease in employment, especially for industries most sensitive to minimum wage laws.  Using Pennsylvania as a control group, we study the labor implications of Maryland's increase in minimum wage in 2022 using a difference-in-differences approach.  Although OLS regressions infer that the minimum wage hike had no effect on employment in the fast-food industry, our more rigorous fixed effects regressions indicate that the minimum wage law had a negative and statistically significant impact on employment, implying that higher minimum wage caused an increase in unemployment among fast-food workers.

"<a href="research/NBA_OwsikTan.pdf" target="_blank">The Contract Year Phenomenon: Investigating the Effect of Contract Uncertainty on NBA Player Performance</a>," with Chris Owsik (Revise &amp Resubmit: <i>Applied Economics Letters</i>)<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This paper investigates whether NBA player performance is affected by their uncertain contract status.  Although our regression results suggest a statistically insignificant change in four advanced metrics for regular season performance during a player's contract year compared to his pre-contract year, we find that these measures of player performance dip significantly in the regular season following the contract year.  On the other hand, player performance during the NBA postseason is unaffected by contract status.  Our results provide evidence of shirking by NBA players during the regular season after signing a new contract, whereas the goal of winning a championship provides a strong incentive to always exert high effort during the playoffs.

"<a href="research/IntJetBlue_DrukkerRuppTan.pdf" target="_blank">The International JetBlue Effect: Affordable Luxury Takes Flight</a>," with Austin Drukker and Nicholas Rupp.<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: JetBlue entered transatlantic markets at comparable prices to competitors, which resulted in an increase in the total number of travelers rather than a reallocation of existing shares—a phenomenon we dub the international JetBlue effect. We estimate that JetBlue’s entry into 13 transatlantic markets from its New York and Boston hubs has generated roughly $321 million per year in consumer surplus, with approximately 27% of the benefits accruing to the business class cabin. We simulate JetBlue’s entry into 13 similar transatlantic markets and estimate that such entry would generate an additional $129 million per year in consumer surplus. We suspect that the international JetBlue effect could arise as other non-legacy US carriers expand into international markets, such as Alaska Airlines’ planned expansion into Asia from its US West Coast hubs.

"<a href="research/JetBlue_RuppTan.pdf" target="_blank">The JetBlue Effect: An Empirical Analysis of Entry on Business-Class Airfares</a>," with Nicholas Rupp.<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We examine how competition impacts price dispersion through the lens of business-class airfares following the entry of a new competitor. In 2014, JetBlue launched a new business-class service offering on U.S. transcontinental flights called Mint. We find that incumbent legacy airlines lowered the distribution of business-class fares (10th percentile, average, and 90th percentile) in the initial quarter of entry. These fare reductions were transitory as we find no significant fare changes in subsequent quarters. We suspect that inelastic business travelers may have played a role in why business-class fare reductions were temporary.
